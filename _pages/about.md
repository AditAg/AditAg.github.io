I am Adit Agarwal, a Senior Undergraduate pursuing my Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), an institute of high repute in India. I have been exploring the field of Machine Learning for the past 2 years now, building with the basic courses by Andrew Ng on Machine Learning and the Introduction to Computer Vision course by Georgia Tech. These courses gave me the motivation to further explore the vastness of this ocean. During my 4th semester (January 2017 - May 2017), I did an Exploratory Project under the guidance of Prof. K.K. Shukla (then, Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT (BHU), Varanasi) on "Emotion Recognition on Static Facial Images" where I had a hands-on experience with implementing and putting to use various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms on detecting emotions from static facial images, using the FAC encodings. Further, through this project, I understood the importance of having a good and comprehensive dataset (something, which wasn't present in this case). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/AditAg/Emotion-detection).
