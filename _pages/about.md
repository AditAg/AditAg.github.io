I am Adit Agarwal, a Senior Undergraduate pursuing my Integrated Dual Degree (B.Tech + M.Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), an institute of high repute in India. I have been exploring the field of Machine Learning for the past 2 years now, building with the basic courses by Andrew Ng on Machine Learning and the Introduction to Computer Vision course by Georgia Tech. These courses gave me the motivation to further explore the vastness of this ocean. During my 4th semester (January 2017 - May 2017), I did an Exploratory Project under the guidance of Prof. K.K. Shukla (then, Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT (BHU), Varanasi) on <b>"Emotion Recognition on Static Facial Images"</b> where I had a hands-on experience with implementing and putting to use various supervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms on detecting emotions from static facial images, using the FAC encodings. Further, through this project, I understood the importance of having a good and comprehensive dataset (something, which wasn't present in this case). You can find the code [here](https://github.com/AditAg/Emotion-detection). 

Further, during the summers (May 2017 - July 2017), I worked at SAG Labs, Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), Government of India, New Delhi; implementing various Deep Learning Architectures including Boltzmann Machines and Autoencoders and using these architectures, at the fascinating intersection of cryptography and deep learning, for <b>pseudo-random number generators</b> and <b>Adversarial Neural Cryptography</b>. You can find all the details [here](https://github.com/AditAg/deepLearning).

Since July 2017, I have also been working in the field of Computer Vision on a multidisciplinary project building an <b>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)</b> capable of navigating underwater while detecting obstacles. The current tasks include:
1) Detecting an underwater gate and navigating through it.
2) Identifying a bin on the swimming pool bed and dropping a marker on it.
3) Identifying a heart-shaped cut out and launching a torpedo through it.

Having worked at the intersection of Cryptography and Machine Learning, both fields have intrigued me a lot specifically, learning and predicting on encrypted datasets using the fields of Multi-Party Computation and Homomorphic Encryption (I am more into the ML part here).
